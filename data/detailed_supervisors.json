        "description": "I am Associate Professor of Climate and Earth Surface Processes in the\nDepartment of Earth Sciences\n,\u00a0and a Supernumerary Fellow of\nUniversity College\n.\nIn Earth Sciences, I lead a research group on modern-day ice-sheet dynamics, with a focus on understanding how\nice-sheet surface melting modulates ice-sheet flow. Our approach pairs in-situ geophysical observations with time-dependent inverse methods, computational modeling, and remotely sensed observations. We investigate Greenland and Antarctic ice sheet, ice shelf, and outlet glacier flow dynamics to better understand the physical mechanisms that destabilize ice sheets with increased surface meltwater production in our warming climate.\u00a0For further details on the research, please see my\nfaculty webpage\n!\nMy role in the Intelligent Earth CDT is linking CDT DPhil researchers with advisors and research projects involving supervision within the Earth Sciences department.\u00a0For further information on the wide range of research happening in Earth Sciences, have a look through recent department\npublication highlights\nand our department's\nresearch themes\n."

        "description": "I am a Professor of Atmospheric Physics working on physical aspects of the climate system, with a focus on clouds, aerosols, and radiation. Clouds play a key role in the climate system, modulating Earth's radiation balance and driving its hydrological cycle. The response of clouds to our changing climate (cloud feedbacks) and to changes in air pollution (aerosol-cloud interactions) remains poorly understood and constitutes the largest uncertainty in our ability to predict climate change.\nIn our\u00a0dynamic\nClimate Processes\nresearch group, we tackle these outstanding climate science questions from multiple approaches, combining theory, numerical modelling, Earth observations with AI and machine learning. \u00a0You can find my publications online under\nORCID\nand\nGoogle Scholar\n."

        "description": "Tim Tang is currently working as a Course Director of the Intelligent Earth CDT programme and also an Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Oxford. He graduated with a BEng from the University of Nottingham. He moved straight to a DPhil at Oxford publishing 5 journal papers including three JFMs. He won first place in the Osborne Reynolds Day competition for the UK's best DPhil student in fluid mechanics. His thesis covered the analysis of field data, experiments, numerical modelling using two different models and the application of data science methods to ocean engineering problems. His current research focuses on extreme events in fluid mechanics with an emphasis on machine learning, including data-driven predictions on extreme waves and extreme structural loading, considering leading order physics such as nonlinear wave dynamics and instabilities, breaking waves, and long-short wave interaction. His recent research on Rogue Wave has been showcased in\nBBC Science Focus\n."

My research focusses on theoretical and experimental analyses of biomechanics as a tool that allows the use of physics and engineering to make concrete qualitative and quantitative predictions about evolutionary adaptations, particularly around aerodynamics, stability and control in flying animals - the main research area of the Oxford Animal Flight group. I am also deeply interested in supporting the development and exploitation of bioinspired technologies, and have pursued this through the formation of spinout companies including Animal Dynamics ltd., where I was Founder, CSO and most recently CEO."
