NameError: The name "'file_path'" is unknown in this context. Please make sure that you defined that variable. Also note that braces not used for variable access have to be escaped by repeating them, i.e. {{print $1}}, when formatting the following:
python supervisor_scraper.py {params.base_url} {config['file_path']}
